VERSIONING: 
	- MAJOR is incremented when you make breaking API changes
	- MINOR is incremented when you add new functionality without breaking the existing API or functionality
	- PATCH is incremented when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes

	1. New projects start at version 0.1.0
		- You are starting with a set of features, not bug fixes
		- Increment the minor version for each subsequent release
	2. Start versioning at 1.0.0 if:
		- Your software is already used in production
		- Other users depend on your software and care when the API changes
		- You are worrying about backwards compatibility
	3. The initial development phase is represented by MAJOR version 0
		- Make as many breaking changes as you want before v1.0.0
	4. Once you have released v1.0.0, API adjustments or other breaking changes are not acceptable without a new MAJOR version change
	5. If you are adding new features without breaking the existing API or functionality, increment the MINOR number.
	6. If you are fixing bugs, increment the PATCH number.
	7. Avoid making frequent breaking changes unless you absolutely need to!
		- Batch major changes together on a branch until you have enough to justify a new major release
